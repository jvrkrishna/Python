#What is OOP
'''
OOP is a programming paradigm to write programs efficiently.
In OOP we will develop mainly using class and object
OOP is very suitable for developing large and complex applications.
OOP follows the Code DRY approach.
In OOP we will wrap data and function into a single unit called class.
Python collects object-oriented mechanism from c++

#Difference between POP and OOP
'''
In Python, POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming) and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are two different programming paradigms. Here's a clear comparison between them:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Definition
POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming)	 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Based on functions and procedures.	     Based on classes and objects.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Focus
POP                                   	OOP
Focuses on functions or procedures.	    Focuses on data and objects.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Structure
POP                                 	OOP
Programs are structured into functions.	Programs are structured into objects and classes.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Data Handling
POP	                                        OOP
Data is global and shared across functions.	Data is encapsulated within objects.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Reusability
POP	            OOP
Less reusable.	Highly reusable through inheritance and polymorphism.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Security
POP	                                        OOP
Less secure â€” data is accessible globally.	More secure â€” data can be private or protected.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Examples in Python
POP 
Example:
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
print(add(5, 3))

OOP Example:
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(5, 3))

ðŸ”¹ 8. Use Cases
POP: Suitable for small, simple programs.

OOP: Better for large, complex, and scalable applications.'''
