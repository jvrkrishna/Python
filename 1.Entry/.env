🐍 Python Full Stack – First Day Class Notes & Roadmap

🔷 1. Welcome & Introduction
    Welcome to Python Full Stack Development!
    By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build complete web applications — from backend logic to frontend design.

A Full Stack Developer works on both:

Frontend: What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)

Backend: Server-side logic and data (Python + Django)

Database: Where data is stored (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

🗺️ 2. Full Stack Roadmap
🧩 Stage 1: Programming Foundation

Language: Python
➡️ Learn syntax, variables, loops, functions, and OOP.
🧠 Why: Python is simple and powerful for backend development.

🎨 Stage 2: Frontend Basics

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
➡️ Build web page structure, design, and interactivity.
🧠 Why: The user interface is built using these.

⚛️ Stage 3: Frontend Framework

React JS
➡️ Create dynamic, single-page applications that connect to the backend.
🧠 Why: React makes the frontend faster and modular.

🐍 Stage 4: Backend Framework

Django (Python Framework)
➡️ Handle server logic, data processing, authentication, and connect to databases.
🧠 Why: Django simplifies backend development.

🌐 Stage 5: API Development

Django REST Framework (DRF)
➡️ Create APIs to connect React frontend with Django backend.
🧠 Why: APIs let frontend and backend communicate.

💾 Stage 6: Database

MySQL or PostgreSQL
➡️ Store and manage user and app data.
🧠 Why: Every application needs persistent storage.

🚀 Stage 7: Deployment

Tools: GitHub, Render, Vercel, Heroku
➡️ Host your web app online for users to access.
🧠 Why: Make your projects live and usable on the internet.

🐍 3. Introduction to Python
What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language used in web development, data science, AI, and automation.

Why Python?
Feature	Benefit
Simple syntax	Easy to read and learn
Cross-platform	Runs on any OS
Huge community	Many libraries & support
Versatile	Used for web, AI, ML, automation, etc.
Example:
print("Hello, World!")

⚙️ How Python Works

You write code in a .py file.

The Python interpreter executes code line by line.

No compilation needed (unlike C or Java).

🧠 First Python Tasks
Try these:
print("Hello World")
print("Hi, this is Rama Krishna")

a = 10
print(a)  # Single-line comment

'''This is a 
multi-line comment 
or block comment'''

Output:
Hello World
Hi, this is Rama Krishna
10

Practice:
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome,", name)
